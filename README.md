- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Readingintherain
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in writing, reading, drawing, musical theatre, and swimming!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computer science, the nuances of film grammar, and the last bit of blocking for Freaky Friday.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them, please.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm currently writing my sixth novel in an attempt to get published before I graduate high school.
